 Hello, Mike. Good afternoon, Josie. How are you? Good, how are you? Good, thank you. Oh, and George, you there as well. Good afternoon. Yes. Hey, how you guys been? It's pretty good. I'll be alright. I don't know about you, Josie. You've been staying well. Wow. You know, I told you I was fake. Yes. Took me nearly two weeks to recover. Yep. That's quite common at the moment. I've had a lot of customers rescheduling those sort of things. Friends have been sacred their kids and stuff like that. So we've been able to dodge it. Now fingers crossed, touching wood. Yeah. But yeah, it's quite right at the moment. Now in your feet, you feel good now, though? Still a little tail end of cough. And otherwise, I'm pretty good now. Not like last week. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good. Good to hear that. It's getting better. Perfect. Thank you guys again for being available. I know last time we had a good half an hour discussion where we looked at some things. We did the video and we've got this time today. So I just wanted to start off first by asking you, guys, have you got any questions, any burning questions that you had after a conversation and after seeing the video? Yeah. I, sorry. I said I would go to send you the email, but I haven't been able to do that. There's one thing we have to look at our current loan. And also, we actually, we managed it to have some saving, like 50k saving, which we can put in. In over. Yeah. Okay. That's a nice. Hopefully that will help a little bit. Yeah, for sure. For sure. So when we were looking at it for you guys, just recapping, we were trying to maximise the amount of cash that you guys can get. And that was the doctor refining strategy of taking both of your loans elsewhere. We didn't want to keep one at one bank and take one to the other because it would create some issues in the future. We're referring with that. If you left the all-malk at all property at ANZ and it came time to refixing it and you only had that property there, they wouldn't offer you the special rates because you know long ahead equity. Okay. So we've got to make sure that we do this together. So that's going to be worthwhile for you guys. Yes. We want to do them together. And also, at this moment, we are not looking at to break that lorry because our saving won't be available until August. Yeah, sure. And to be honest, it's the 15th of August. It's going to be the day that you guys switch over. We want to make sure we're allowing you enough time to get that advice from the accountant because one thing we spoke around was the ownership of the property because you may decide to transfer the investment property into your annual investment company. So give a new time for that. Have the chat to both either your accountant, Joseph. So now you've got one for your family trust or for me to provide your details through to AAT accounting who we refer our customers to. We don't receive a referral fee, but it's just I use them personally and we refer our customers. They get great experience and they get great advice from them. So we just want to allow time. So that's good to know. 15th of August is what we're aiming for. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Cool. Okay. So just kind of recapping the video then we were looking at the total lending that you guys have got being the core lending is for 71 against your home. 820 against the Ulmukhara is 1, 2, 9, 1. And then we divide it by 0.8. So we needed a value of 1614. Okay. So looking at those two together ones that are one four is the just the value of the property that you need to have. Oh. Not the lending just the value of the property for you to make sure that you've got that 70% equity in one and 80% equity in the up. So 20% equity in the only five, 30% of the investment for us to take it to the same bank. Yeah. If we go your own property is 875 to 775 was really. And the okay. You go sorry. So if we need to have the like the new valuation of the house which companies should we go like do we need to ask the you know the formal valuation company or just the only valuation company is okay. Yeah. Great question. We organize it for you directly through velocity but we wouldn't we would we would not go ahead with it until we know we can get approved with the banks in terms of the affordability fee. So what I'll do is I'm sure I'll go through that to that gather information takes a couple weeks. I'll be after know by looking at it going yay or nay this is going to work in terms of affordability because I don't want you guys spend a thousand dollars on a valuation and then it goes I actually know we can't get a refund it's approved. I wouldn't do that okay. So 15th August is great it's going to give us enough time to go through these sort of things. The good thing is that you've got that cash available that means that your own property at waterside drive does not need to be as high so it gives us a little bit of flexibility. Yeah. Yeah. Good. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. Perfect. All right. Okay. So we'll continue on then. So this is good in terms of getting an understanding from you guys around what you're wanting to do. We'll look at a multitude of lenders for you ideally. So for you guys you've you've mentioned that first call you've been to your banks have done this before. Have you guys heard of ASB go? ASB go. No. So that sort of like a part of the ASB bank but it's sort of a different account. That's right so it's done through advisors only so only we can access it for clients. Benefits of ASB go and the reason I'm thinking to this one for you guys is that they have got a really great product offering and they give good cash great rate but they mean you don't have to switch your banking you're only have to switch your mortgages. Yeah. We've already got accounts with ASB so yeah because that was one of our other banks that we had to loan with at one stage and get called with it. It's just a privilege having to switch your arm. You're a good like your rental incomes and you don't have to switch your wages and all those sort of things. Well okay. It'll just take the loan payments directly out of your existing A and Z account. So it's a great way for that having so you don't have to switch everything which kind of makes a lot easier for you guys. So ASB go will be able to deduct it straight out of our own Z accounts. That's right. Yep. Okay. Yep. So just just that's one that you can potentially look at. We can go ASB direct but they do ask you to take all your banking where is this the advisor on your channel just makes a lot easier in terms of the switch. Cool. Okay. So what we're going to do now is I just want to gather more of your personal details. Okay. So we did the rough up. Now we're going to go into it in a bit of detail. So first off, Jodie, can you please what is your data birth? 10th February 1972. 10th February 1972. Thank you. Great. And where were you originally born? Oh China. And what is your residency status New Zealand citizen? Citizen. Citizen? No. Did that mean you had to forego your Chinese passport or can you have both? No. I have to give up the Chinese passport. I only got the New Zealand passport now. Yeah. It's hard. My mother-in-law is from Malaysia and same thing with her. She got New Zealand passport. She had to give up her Malaysian passport. So yeah. But the quite good thing for now is like if you want to go to China for 30 days, it don't need to apply for the visa. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But her, she had to go into the foreign rescue and she found it really hard when she went to Malaysia to go to her family. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. All right.

So how has yours made up, Josie? How do you get paid to base salary? I got a hundred to fifteen. I think the panoriff of ten. I don't know. Sure. Money not mine. One hundred. Yeah. One on five. Yeah. Do you put in three, four, six, eight or ten percent into your TV saver? I'll represent. Three percent. And do you know how much you have in your TV saver? I think it's around a hundred more sold and who is your TV saver worth? ESB. ESB. Okay. Have you received any financial advice around your TV saver? Not really. I'm quite happy with ESB alone. Understand. So I can provide financial advice in regards lending. But when it comes to the TV saver and their investments, I can only give you information and I need to refuged details on. For just for bank funds, I know that they underperformed the market over the last ten years and it makes a huge difference to make sure you're in the right fund. So for you, you know, you've got quite a lot in there and you could look at, you know, send what's the better provider for you. So you're getting good bank for back looking at your mortgages might be worthwhile looking at the TV saver as well. You don't have to look at that later, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And it's independent of what we do. Okay. So it's got, right? So thank you for that. Did it all go there? Now what's your preferred titles that miss misses or miss? No. You're good. No, no, miss it.

We've got your income. Great. Now we've got the income for the Ulmukuro property. That's 680 a week. When was the last time you reviewed the rental income? When is the tenancy up for a new? We only just got tenancy in recently. So we can't touch it. Okay. Yeah. Good tonight. Yeah. Cool. We're running. Only a month or so? Yeah. Now that's cool. Okay. Oh, that's good tonight. Actually, only a month ago, because then it won't shut three months and the accounts sweet. So we just need a. For example, or I can use the market tenancy. Cool. Or we've got our first invoice from does it first invoice count? It will, but you need for banks, you need three months of income. I can't, I can't. I can't count otherwise. We need a verified a different way, which would be using the rental appraisal. And that's why I think because you guys use top of my head was classic builder. Yeah. Yeah. And I've got that whole subdivision. So they'll know what it goes for and that sort of thing. So that'll be nice. And then, Josie, you've got that family trust there. You're a trustee and then you and your daughter have been a fisheries and then you shared with me that you have quite a bit of rental income in there. So the three properties are earning around that seven hundred a week or seven. Fifty. Do you? Yeah. The bank accounts for the trust. Who do you do the day-to-day banking with under the trust? Oh, rest a pack. Okay. So does all the rental incomes go to waste packs for that trust? Yeah. Great. Good tonight. Because I know that you've got some lending with Bank of China. That was the seven hundred and seventy thousand. And that was against the totaling of property. Yes. Okay. And then you've also got that flexi where you've got a hundred and ten K limit with eighty thousand owing. Yeah. That's with Bank of China as well. That that amount of lending. No, that's back. Westpac has got the ATK. Okay. Good tonight. Yes. Yeah. It's a ATK. It's with Westpac. And confirming it hasn't been three years. So you wanted to leave the family trust out of what we're doing. We're personally, we're just looking at your personal stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I tried. Yeah. Cool. That's all good. Lovely. Um, great. Okay. So that's all good. Lovely. So we're going through now assets and investments. We've talked about your key to service. Okay. Um, we'll now talk about your vehicle. So do you guys own a car each? Yeah. We have two cars and we're in there. I'm the separate names. Yeah. Yeah. One. One. One. One. One. One. One. One. Right. What's the value of these cars? Uh, roughly. What you would tell them today? Uh, the blue case probably only twenty five K. Oh, that's good. Yeah. Yeah. You're trying to say seven years. Yeah. And the other one. Uh, what's your age of 16 K? Yeah. We bought that around 16 K and that's a... Only last October. Last October. I saw that. That's a Toyota aqua mate. Um, that year, 2015. 2015, 2015, Toyota aqua. And the other one's done under 100,000 Ks. That's mine. Yeah. Nice. Perfect. And then, Joseph, your car, what's, what you're making? It's the Suzuki. It's a Suzuki Batara Sport mate. Um, sports. Look at you. So yeah, that's the, sorry, it's a turbo. So, yeah, the Suzuki Batara Turbo. It's a 1.5 and that was a 2018 model. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. A board of 2018. Yeah. So that hasn't quite hit the 100,000 yet either. No. Oh, wow. Far out when I was, um, what you guys were in Piespar, I was living out in Nolmokoro and we, the manor case that we racked up was crazy. It was like 50 or 60,000 in a year. It just, yeah. Well, it's because we travel in for work and then we travel in in the weekend twice or three times. It just adds up, you know? Yeah. Yeah. That's right. Yeah. Okay. Cool. Perfect. Um, now, do you guys have any other investment funds or like, she's either managed funds, anything like that? Um, I have shares. Oh, my. But it's not, it's not a huge amount. Yeah. So I've got shares with Meridian. Yep. And that's just over $3,000 in shares. I think it's like $2,100 or something like that. Just round it down to about three grand. That'll be enough. Yeah. Cool. Perfect. And then, and then shares that I have. Now, that's cool. Um, what is any cash funds that you've got, Josie and your family trust at the moment? No cash is all along. Yeah, I could, I know you're good. You've got that flex. It's really so that's okay. That 50,000 you guys are getting. Do you mind sharing with me how you're going to be receiving that money? Yeah. Ah, the 50 grand. So we've got about 39 in term deposit. No, no, no, hold it. We get that 50k. Oh, no, no, no. If you've got it as a two deposit, it's fine. I'm just wanting to know, did you receive that from someone as a gift? But you're okay. So that, um, so, so what actually happened was that I got an insurance claim for a medical issue. Yep. That happened almost 10 years ago. And if my insurance said you could actually claim on it. So what I actually responded was about, um, 68k. So I got 68k plus an additional 8k on some other payments that they owed me as well. So out of that money, what we did was we still had some money owing on the overdraft overdraft. So we paid it off and then put the rest in terms of deposit. Yep. So that's where that money came from. So the additional money, yeah, so yeah, how long ago was that that you received the payout? Oh, croaky. That was only about how long we hadn't seen. It was only about a couple of months ago. Three months ago. Yeah, perfect. You got around say 70 or grand. You got paid out and then you've paid off some of your flexible high-level facility with ANV and the VREM, that's $39,000 on turn deposit. And had you got that train off on the 15th of August as well, have you? Yeah, yeah. Before that. Yeah. Okay. How, how much before that is it coming off timewise? Oh, I don't know. Oh, wait, just a week before. Oh, wait. Yeah. A week? That's fine. No, no, that's all good. The reason I'm asking that is that, let's say you're going to use some of this cash towards the contribution. The solicitor needs like a day or two for it to be in there. They trust the count before settlement. It'll be there. You're all good. I just want to make sure I know when they're like on the same day. It creates like an issue because the bank doesn't pay out for like 3,000 yen and then you're trying to transfer it and they can't do that. Yeah. I'm not sure that this is all going to fly nicely for you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's a way before we make sure that will happen. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. So, do you all guys' salaries at the moment go to ANV? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. Perfect. Now, let's all good. People who need to pack, we can change because we all got to the account at AFB and also VAT pack. Yeah. That you're a good, you're a good, good to know. Now, oh, we've got asked, do we have anyone under the age of 18 or over the age of 18 reliant on your income? No. Okay. Cool. So, and so just the tool you're living at the home at the moment? Yeah. Yeah. No borders with you or anything like that? No. No. We've only got two cats. We can't. Cats don't pay rent, mate. They cost. So, we work better. No, no. It's all good. That's the appreciation that is. How good. Perfect. So, incomes, we've got the three investment, four in total. So, three another family trust, one in your personal name. You guys got really good salaries. So, that's great. Any other forms of incomes that I'm missing here from you guys? No. You need it. I wish. I have quite another one. Yeah. I would like to earn some extra money, but she won't leave me go out at some shooting. Who knows? Maybe we could get your cash incentive, I can get you against the guards to do the possum trends. Oh, no. I've got the rifles, mate. So, just finally, let me go out. You're a good person. Possum's on the weekend. I was going to ask is, before I go into the expenses part, talk me through more around your guys kind of strategy, because I know that you said you wanted to hold your milk at all properties for 10 years, pay it off, sell it and then put that towards your own home. Are you trying to look at other investment properties as part of this or you're happy with the one? No. It's kind of your ideal. No. We just want to focus on Omocaroo. Yeah. Yeah, sure. So, ideally, because I know that you guys were concerned about starting to pay some of the principal off the investment property, it makes financial sense to pay your own debt off your own home first, versus paying off an investment property. And that just around just the tax deductibility. So now that there's a 100% tax deductible, clients leave their properties on interest only, their investment, and then they focus paying off their own occupied, because there's no tax deductibility on your own property. So you're basically reduced the amount of tax you can pay back if you pay down the Omocaroo property. And then, yeah, you guys got 18 months interest only remaining at the moment. So, when we're looking to the resessment, we can get you another five as part of it. Okay. So we'll be looking to get you five years of additional interest only for Omocaroo, and then you can keep your existing home the way that it is. Lower rates means that you can then pay that one off faster, give you flexibility, all those sort of things. Cool. Right. Yeah. So essentially expenses. So what we're going to do now is talk around you guys household expenditure. Okay. That's not what you actually spend. That's what you would generally spend if you were a budget for a week. Okay. First one is food, which includes restaurants, takeaways, and groceries. How much do you guys spend a week? Or do you do it? Or not like 300? Yeah. At the most. Yep. That's okay. Yeah. Great. So would that include alcohol and nicotine if need be? We don't. We don't smoke and we barely drink. Cool. Now that's good. Do you have any allowance for entertainments? I think it's like concerts, going rugby games, those sort of things? No. Not that we're good. No, we're boring. No, you're all good. You're all good. It's a big thing. It's completely different. We're clothing. Man, I've got a holy undies broke. So we call it 50 a month for you both. Yeah, about that. I've got a brand new. Yeah. Cool. Yeah. Tell it to me. This is only, this is for your own home. Okay. Okay. Yeah. How much do you pay for power? A month. Well, power and the internet together is like 250 a month. Yeah. And we have we have gas bottles as well. So that's around about maybe a hundred. So if you sort of, that's about 120 every 140 every three months. Yeah. Two to three months. Oh, great. Probably like 17 bucks. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And then so you're powering the tenets to 50 a month. You've got gas then and what about your mobile phone bills? 17 dollars a week each because we're both on skinny 17 months. Oh, no, a month. Because we're both on skinny. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. All right. That is a month. So that's 34 plus 34, which is 17 a month each or mobile with skinny. Okay. All right. Let me add that one up. So we go 250 plus 50, 34. Cool. So it's about the three, 50 a month max for you guys there. Next one's around transport. So this includes fuel parking, wafer, radio, those sort of things. So we'll start off with the first one. Just fuel. How much do you guys been a week on fuel? Well, Josie normally drives the hybrid around. So once a month will probably fill the hybrid up and that will cost us around about 70 bucks a month. And with the Suzuki, it depends on whether we use it to go anywhere, but I would suggest that the Suzuki made about 100 a month. Yeah. Cool. Great. And then if we allow, so that's one, 70 months, I'm going to go here one, 30 months up and above that for Waff, Rio, maintenance. That's 300 a month for you guys for vehicles. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're lucky enough to have someone that comes to the home and does the cleaning, gardening for you or you guys do it yourselves. Now we'll do it ourselves. Yeah. Cool. We're good. Okay. Insurancees. Now this is not for the investment properties. It's just for your personal property. Okay. So we start off with house and contents. Who's that with? Tower. Tower. Great. Cool. Do you pay it as one payment or is it a separate payment? I'm going to go around. No, actually house insurance with ASB. Oh, is it? Yeah. Oh, no. Sorry. Home content with ASB and house with tower. Sorry. Yeah. House insurance with tower. Home and contents with ASB. Okay. Cool. So the contents insurance is done through ASB and then the actual, the house insurance itself is done through the tower. Yeah. Cool. All right. Can you share with me the costs that you pay for those? Okay. We've got a few insurances with tower because we insure at the cost through it as well. What's the health insurance for the home or crow? It doesn't matter because we take it for the end of the income off, hit count for real estate agencies for rights insurance, those sort of things. So it's only for your own home that we need to know. Okay. I don't know which one is which. It's kind of like 130 bucks. Okay. So what's that for the house? You think? House. Yes. The house. Yeah. Of course. So that is the 182. We'll be one. Okay. So that's perfect. What's the contents with ASB? How much is that? $65. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Perfect. Now the next one is the cars with tower. What is the monthly cost with him? Yeah. I think it's only $55.56 for the car. For the Suzuki. Okay. And for the aqua, we paid for the car insurance for the aqua with who? With ASB? I can't remember now. That's okay. So you've got so tower is for one of them, which is about 56 a month. And then you paid the other car as an annual premium. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So for that one, if we can't find in the payments and our team do a lot of digging to find these things, we can't find them. We just need your annual renewal, which shows what the amount is. Okay. Yeah. I can't dig that out from the email. Yeah. Cool. Lovely. All right. Now the next one is around your personal insurancees. So you guys have got potential income, trauma, disability insurance. Do you have any of that in place at the moment? I've only got a life insurance. That's okay. Who was that with and what's their cost? So that's AIA. Yep. And that cost me $50 a month. Okay. Now, question. You said you've got to pay out for something medical. Do you have medical insurance with someone else? Was that the AIA? No. I had it with that was sort of a one of those insurances where something bad happens here and you can get a pay out, but that's only a one off. So now I'm like a trauma insurance. Yeah. A trauma one. That's it. So I don't pay the payment anymore because once I claimed on it, they cancelled it. Yeah. Who was that with? Because it might appear in your guys' bed stainless. Like three years ago. That was through AIA. Yeah. Cool. So just to let you know AIA vitality. They are the same ones who was ASB go. All right. So they're the landing arm of AIA. So it's the same sort of company. Yeah. That you guys have more of this through. Cool. Okay. What about you, Joseph? Do you have something cross-grabbing? Yeah. I got to the I think life and the medical together with the partner life. Partner? Great. Yep. Yeah. And paying now it's paying like $310 a month and just going to a renewal soon. Great. That was going to be the question. Making sure you're getting it reviewed. So you guys have got insurance advisors. So that's good. That is looking at partner's life. Great. They reviewed each year. Really important that you do. So okay. Cool. Now any other insurance that I'm missing out for you guys. So we've got the house, the contents. We're spoken about the cars. We've talked to speak about life, medical, anything out there I'm missing. No, that's all. Cool. All right. Now rates for you guys. I'll be able to find that through local council. That's easy because you've got towing a city council plus the Bay of Plenty regional for your own home. Yeah. And I think a three part. Are you sure? Because you have Western Bay for Ulmukuru. Yeah. Yeah. And those rates are high. So that's my property up there was like $5,000. Well, so it's 4.4 for the Bay of Plenty regional. Sorry. I'm going to have the Western Bay and then 600 for the regional. It's about 5 grand a year for rates. Yeah. Yeah. It's quite high. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. Now, we've obviously got no daycare or private schooling. Next one is subscriptions. So do you guys have anything like Netflix? Just Netflix mate. Yep. Cool. And that's usually about like 30 bucks a month. Yeah. Thanks. Something. No, you're going to have like gym memberships or anything like that. No. No. We're going to. Do we make any regular donations or any tibings? No, we're not religious. No, no, no, no, regular donations that you guys do. No, no, no. Yeah. Not like me. They get caught up with those people outside the supermarket and donating to free of people I get caught on. I can't say no. We donated something before to the part foundation of our way. We've done the odd donation from time to time, but it's not a regular payment that carries out. No, we're stopped. We just stopped that one. Yeah. Cool. Great. Okay. Now, other debt. So these include things like who's the lines credit cards overdraft. So we'll start with credit cards. Do we have any credit cards at the moment? I have credit card with ASB and the limit is 15 solid. Cool. That's what I say in your name. How much do you owe on the card at the moment? Six and half. Cool. Is that paid off for for which month? Sorry, what's that? Is that paid for every month? Yeah, yeah. We pay in four every month. Normally, actually, every month, normally is only around three thousand. This time is a little bit high because I just had the insurance for my family after-hautists and I paid them in like the annual one. That's why it's quite high for this month, but normally it's only like three thousand or three and a half. Cool. That's completely understandable. What about your judge? Any credit cards? Yeah, I've got ASB credit card, but my limit's only at grand. I'm just kind of like my bugger. Yeah, that's just kind of like for emergencies and I probably own a bit. I just under 200 bucks on that. Yeah, cool. And that's what ASB said. Yeah. Got nothing with Westpac or ANZ, no credit cards. No, no, no. Do you guys use any buy now pay later services like after pay? No, no, no, no, I'm kind of full of it. We don't get it. Yeah, it's not unfortunately it's not the same with a lot of people at the moment. They kind of go, oh, I'll have it now and then pay later and then they forget the payments and then they get charged a lot. So we send that quite frequently. Do you guys have, while I'm thinking of it, two card or gym visa? No. No. No. Cool. Cool. All good. Okay. Five rates. Sorry, you go. You guys, will there something on the set? I do have another overdraft along at ASB. It's like 100K. Sure. That's a limit. It's under my name. It's a 100K limit, but it's apparently it's no longer there. Sure. So is that under the trust or under your personal name? Personal name. How is that? Because the properties are under the trust. If you've got a guarantee from the trust in your own name. I had this one for a long time. It's called the all-orbid home loan. Yes, sure. Okay. So you've got the all-bid home loan. I'm just trying to figure out how that comes about. That might have been through trust somehow. Yeah. I'm just trying to think. Trust me. Yeah. Yeah. I'm just trying to have a look here. What have we got? We've got Bank of China. We've got Westpac. Who? ASB, all but. Yeah. I'm just trying to think. Actually, the Westpac, the loan at a Westpac, the overdraft loan is under my name as well. Okay. Yep. I'm just trying to think. Yes. Yes. Sure. So the borrower-dass avenue property is currently with ASB under the trust. So my guess is that you already have a guarantee from the trust in your personal name so that you could get that involved in credit. So that makes sense. Cool. That's good for me to know. So I'm just going to put that there in your personal name. And the notes as a family trust is guaranteeing it. Yeah. Pretty much. I have already paid off the loan for the borrower-dass, but they still use that one as a guarantee, I guess. Yeah, they will. Which is fine. And then you said also that the Westpac revolving credit facility that they have lodged is done under your name as well. Same thing family trust guaranteeing it. Yeah, maybe. Yeah. That's good. It's the same amount of lending, which name you have it in doesn't make much of a difference. We just need to make sure because when the documents come through, we've just got to match them up. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's why I thought I'd better do what I didn't know. No. Yeah, cool. No, you're good. You're good. Perfect. Anything else do you think of missed in terms of lending? No, that's all I have. Yeah, cool. Yeah, I see a hiding from me, honey. No, you're a good, you're a good. Okay. So what I'm going to do now, guys, thanks so much. There's just going to be a couple of minutes. I just want to review my notes. Make sure I've got everything that I need. And then we'll kind of discuss next steps. Okay. Hey, I can tell you I do have a little money in Toronto. So if we really really need, I can Yeah, sure. Okay. That's of the that's of the valuation comes in low and you want to get some funds. You've got additional funds. Yeah, I've got a little bit of money and cooperative bank as well, mate. Oh, okay. How much you got there? Probably by the time it rolls around about 5K. Yeah, cool. So, no, it's good to know as part of it because if we get real tight, then you guys got some additional options. Cool. Right. Yes, I'm over reviewed the notes and I'll be back shortly. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Cool. Thanks, guys. Yes. If we are tied, I can tell you what the money. I already got one. I think we get it. If we get fairly, we get for it. I think it was too far. No, it's not going to take a little bit of time. I will find none. I guess you are getting another thing I want him to know. Let's go up and down, quickly. Be kind. It makes a weirdWhat about you? It makes a CM's yard tickling They play in a Mosquito This piece I'm going to play Marjong. Oh, the name of the name is... I'm going to pick up some time and some... from...

She wants to get this mix so she's a mix of chanting. I don't want to. That's that's the way. I remember coming to Thank you guys for your patience. That's right. Cool. Awesome. So looking at the information, great. It's what I need to basically move forward. I was just working out a couple of things while I had you guys on hold. First one was, what do we need in terms of not getting evaluation? How much cash would you need to put into it? And considering a look as at today, that works out to be 60,000. So we're just a little bit short if you did not want to get the valuation. So we're just going to get the valuation. Okay. If you're going to hit 60,000, is there a mount for you to be able to take these properties at the value they are today across the new bank and then get the special rates? Okay. But the valuation you are based on is today's one from the bank. That's right. It's through for lossily, which is the bank valuation systems. They look at it and they go, all right, this is what they'll use. If you want higher than that, you've got to then get an independent valuation, which costs about 1,000 bucks. Yeah. One that we do through the valuation system. And remember, we only hit go on that if we believe it's actually the, you know, I'd be able to, that's going to be made and that's where I'm going to work through the figures with you guys. Yeah. Yeah. But what about when we get to the moment in August, even the value bar up? Yeah. So what happens is the value lasts for a month. So what we do is we look at the time of months, we've got all the documents, we get updated values through the valuation system. Highly unlikely they're going to go up by 60 grand, like 30 grand, both of the properties. But we'll have a look at it and I'll definitely give you that advice going, hey, they've gone up by this amount, say 20, 30K, which means you only need to put in 30K cash because you want to do that. And we'll look at those parts as part of it. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. George, I didn't grab from you. Sorry, your email address. So my email address is G. Yep. Got my last thing. 7 0. 7 0. At gmail.com. At gmail.com. Yeah. So let's have a look at that's all lowercase except for the 7 0. Okay. Yeah. Of course. No, you're all good. Sorry. Because what I'm doing to, I'm going to send you guys is how we're going to upload the documents. Okay. We have partnered together with a company called Affordix, which is an easy way for you to get your documents because I know this is one of the hardest parts for clients is getting all the documents to us. So we're trying to make it as easy as possible. And to do that, you can log in to your internet banking and then it's going to send all the details to us. So we're going to be able to do that manually uploading each individual one. Okay. And then you're going to receive an email. So I'm just putting that in there. So it's. So g. Now truck. 70 at gmail.com. And. Some documents you will have to send to us through the portal where you have to manually upload them. So I'm going to send you the documents. And Josie, what's sorry, I actually asked what's the name of your family trust? The J way somebody trust. So J way family trust. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Great. I better than update the name because it's just got I've just put 2B determined. So I'll change that to. You're the trustee. The beneficiary. So J way. Yeah. So J way. Yeah. Cool. So the space J way together. Yeah. Cool. Great. Cool. Okay. So first email that you guys are going to receive is from a 40. Okay. So I'm just saying that through to you now. That's the one that you're going to go into upload your back. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. The next email that you're going to receive is going to be from me from the good broker and LT. So we've got a support team that's going to help you through this. All right. Any questions that you've got regarding the documents they'll come back to. We worked together with. We've got two support staff at the moment being Leah and Minette. Okay. Oh yeah. They are going to be copied into the email. So we've got a support team that's going to help you through this. All right. Any questions that you've got regarding the documents they'll come back to. So I'm just checking here. It just saves first off. You know, I think you guys for your time and verbally engaging our services. So reconferring. We don't charge the fee directly to the client. We get paid a commission if the deal goes ahead with a bank. Okay. Yeah. So no no fee for you. I don't get paid a referral fee for referring you to AAT accounting. If you decide to go through with them. It's just as a thing. Want to make sure you guys are looked after. Required documents. Okay. So you can need that rental appraisal for all more. You'll have to upload the trust document for JY family trust. So that's for me to confirm that you're the sole trustee. Not so much to be an official. But that you're the trustee. Your guys ID and that could be simply driver license or part of. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. The bank statements will come through that of 4DX when you log in. And it's going to pull through all your credit cards or your mortgages. All that sort of stuff. Any questions about any of that. Um. No question. Sorry. Got a blank. So are you. I mean, are you looking to get to the long for us from ASB or from other banks? Yeah. Sure. So we to be honest, we do it through a multitude of lenders. We have to provide recommendations on who we're going to go to and why. Our preferred option based upon this would be ASB go, which is the advisor only channel. But we could. And that's for you to maximize that cash. There's no points staying at a. Is it because they're not going to give you a point 9% cash incentives to take the loans. They're really there. So you mean ASB could have given us the 0.9%. Cash back. That's quick. That's right. Okay. Okay. We are. We're okay with. I mean, with any bank. Yeah. That's cool. So I'm probably going to be looking at you guys. The three. Actually, it'll probably just be ASB and. So you're going to be able to go through your with at the moment. Yeah. For one other thing. So yeah, those are the two. But it's probably going to be ASB because they've just got a great product offering. We can increase repayments at no cost of up to a thousand a month. Westpac is like 20% of the payments. Just because you guys bit more flexibility. You don't have to change all your banking all that sort of stuff. But yeah, you're going to be getting around that 11,000 cash for taking the loans there. So it'll be 0.9% of what the lending is. And that will be determined on the valuations. Those sort of things. Interest rates. Really important at the moment we've been able to get 4.85. That's going to make a massive difference for you guys. I worked it out before I gave you a call. Let's have a look at the notes here. So. You mean the 4.85 is the lowest one you can get for now. Is that today correct? So the thing is that your loans coming off in August. We've got our announcement happening on the night of July. Yes. Correct. So you'll be getting obviously whatever the best rates are then. And this is another good thing about ASB Go. Is that if you lock into a rate, let's say on the 10th of August. Yeah. And then on the 15th of August there's a better rate. They'll give you the better rate at my cost. Oh, great. I guess. And then there's also another one on the other OCR announcement on August the 20th. So I follow this closely. Obviously, I don't know exactly what's happening. But I can give you information about what's happening in the market. You may know that Mo may know the same stuff. But if the interest rates are turning down at the moment, you may get a better rate by August. I think fingers crossed that goes down by 25 basis points. And then hopefully again in August, noting that the OCR isn't directly related to the fixed rates. So what that means is it goes down by 25 basis points to fix rates. Don't go down exactly that amount. In the last couple of years when the OCR has gone down by 2%, you can just fix rates to come down by about 1.9. So there is some sort of correlation there. Yeah, yeah. The difference of new interest rates, even at 485, your repayments would be down by $280 a week for Omukuroa on interest only. Mm hmm. Okay. So saving off 1200 a month. Yeah. Because you guys are guessing a topping this up quite a lot at the moment. Yeah, yeah. We're kind of like topping up like 2000 amongst. Yep. So now you're only going to be topping it up 800 a month. Yeah, that would be great. Yeah. Based on this rate, and let's just say it goes down more, but just working on 800 a month, yeah, we can, you know, 200 a week. I can, you can kind of understand that it's okay. But, you know, the 2000 a month is quite a lot. Yeah, you can. That's why we were struggling to get rid of only like the floating long for the last two years. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, you can get that. So, the cash then you guys could use is you can put that into the account to then pay for the next 10 months, for example. Yeah. We would have that overdraft along again. So we are going to pay that. Hopefully we can pay that back pretty quick. Which one's that one that went under your trust or in your personal name? Yeah. We still want to have the. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Again, that's on that valuation and those sort of things. Can you guys check to see you've received both of those emails that I've sent through? Yeah. I'm starting online now. Oh, look at you. Happy days. Cool. So you guys receive them. Any final questions that you may have for me? Yeah. Got both emails from you as well. Great. Perfect. Yeah. I think we are okay for now. We don't have any other questions. Oh, you guys got emailing everything. Please come back to me. I know there's a few documents that you've got to work through. I get that. You need any help. Let me know. Happy jump on the call and get them sorted for you. I'm going to be working on looking at the affordability and those sort of things in the background. One thing that I've got to look at. And quick, so I think I'm going to take a look and go through some of the things that I've been transferring to you. So I think the biggest thing that I've been doing here is that you've got that rental income in the trust. I've got to figure out how much can I allocate that to you guys join application? Some banks treat that differently. So I'll look into that as well because that may be a decide on who we go with. Okay. Yeah. Cool. I contacted my accountant who did the family transfer one. So we are going to use him again for our text, text, the return fee. OK. Yeah, sure. Make sure they're proactive around the ownership structure. So that look through company and making sure they're in those like chattel valuations, those sort of things. OK. Yeah, yeah. I will put them all about that. Yeah. Yeah, cool. Because if you're not getting the traction that you want and you want me to introduce to Anthony, let me know because I can get that done before you guys do the refinance. OK. Thank you. Yeah. Awesome. You're welcome. Yeah, OK. Cool. Again, thank you so much for your time. I'll let you guys get back to you evening. Thank you. Thank you so much. So there's also two choices. Two choices. Thank you. Thank you. Bye.
